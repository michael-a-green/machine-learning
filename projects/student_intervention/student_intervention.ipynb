    "### Decision Tree\n",
    "#### Real World Application\n",
    "Decision trees have been used to predict which books in a library can be stored in off-site low-cost storage and which books should remain in the library.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Reference:_\n",
    "Silverstein, C. and Shieber, S. M. Predicting individual book use for off-site storage using decision\n",
    "trees. _Lib_.1Q. 66(3):266–293,-1996.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Strengths of the Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees are easier to and understand and visualize. Decisions trees also perform well even if its assumptions are sometimes violated by the true underlying model that generated the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification, decision trees are very fast at predicting.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Weaknesses of the Model\n",
    "Decision trees can be unstable due to small variations in the data that can result in completely different trees being generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning the optimal tree is NP-complete. Thus most decision tree learners use heuristics to generate trees and usually generate locally optimal trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why is this a good candidate for this problem\n",
    "The amount of data is small. I also hypothesize that there are very few attributes that yield most of the information gain so I'm thinking the time to create the learner will be small.\n",

    "_Reference_:\n",
    "RADA, Rexhep; RUSETI, Bashkim. Some Applications of K-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm In Customer Relationship Management.\n",
    "#### Strengths of the Model\n",
    "KNN is very effective at training noisy data and is good at training very large data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Weaknesses of the Model\n",
    "Inference of KNN algorithms is slower than other learning algorithms (lazy algorithm). The accuracy of a KNN classifier is dependent on the quality of the distance function. The distance function quality is a function of domain knowledge. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why is this a good candidate for this problem\n",
    "I think that students that pass or fail have a lot in common with each other (they are close to each other) and the number of features they have in common is small relative to the total number of features. I also don't think it's linear so I think an instance-based approach is a good choice.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Strengths of the Model\n",
    "Boosting learns fast. Is able to make use of other learning algorithms and combine weak classifiers of these learning algorithms and create arbitrarly accurate classifiers. Another interesting strength of boosting is that it can exhibit increasing ability to generalize even after it is no longer able to increase accuracy over a training data set.\n",
    "#### Weaknesses of the Model\n",
    "If the underlying weak classifier overfits, then the boosted form of the algorithm will over fit and cannot recover from this.\n",

    "I can combine simple decision trees together via boosting to create a very accurate classifier. I'm concerned that I may not be able to identify which features to put into a single decision tree to result in a single highly accurate classifier but with boosting, I can use the algorithm to create a set of simple decision trees that automatically pick the right features."

    "The AdaBoost model is an \"ensemble prediction model.\" By that I mean that it calculates a prediction by combining the predictions of several simpler models that it automatically creates. Each sub-model prediction is weighted according to how hard it had to work to come up with that prediction.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's say we begin with a set of ten data items as shown below\n",
    "\n",
    "![step0](step0.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The green +'s and red -'s are the real labels of these items. AdaBoost learns by generating in a step by step process classifiers that are just a little bit better than random guessing i.e., better than 50% by some margin. That margin we will call the error rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "So in the first step, Adaboost generates a classifier h1 that works like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![step1](step1.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "All items to the left are predicted by h1 as +'s, all items to the right are predicted as -'s. As you can see h1 gets 3 of the 10 items incorrect. At step one it thinks all items are equally important, so the error rate at step one is 0.3. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now the strength of Adaboost is that it will use this error to calculate weights for the items that it classifies incorrectly. These weights will be used to judge how well the subsequent classifier must work to be accepted for that next step. I will try to express this in the drawing by drawing items that have an increased weight larger than items that have an unchanged weight, and items whose weight has increased as smaller. Also I will draw items smaller or bigger from one step to the next to try to show how the weights change.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the result after AdaBoost generates a learner for step 2, called h2:\n",
    "\n",
    "![step2](step2.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "In step 2, the learner gets 5 items correct and 3 items wrong. You may think that it has again an error rate of 0.3. In fact the error rate is 0.21 because it was able to in this step guess the 3 items it got wrong correctly in step 1 that are now very important to get right in this current step. The three items that are important are the three green pluses in the upper right of the square that I drew a little larger to express their increased importance to the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "AdaBoost then proceeds to step 3 as shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![step3](step3.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "In step 3, AdaBoost generates classifier h3. This time it only guesses two items incorrectly (one minus and one plus). It's error rate is better than 0.2 because it guessed correctly the three -'s it got wrong in step 2 (the three larger minues in the bottom center of the square) which consequently have become more important to get correct in this step, while at the same time continuing to correctly guess items it got wrong in the past in this current step.\n",
    "\n",
    "These three steps continue until it's not possible to generate a classifier that provides a better error rate, or when you've hit the required acccuracy, or you've run out of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the learning process described above is complete, AdaBoost then combines the classifiers h1, h2, h3, etc. into a single classifier H. This classifier is simply a *weighted sum* of the little h's. The weights are those that were produced as part of the learning process described above.\n",
