    "\n",
    "#### Why is this a good candidate for this problem\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Weaknesses of the Model\n",
    "Inference of KNN algorithms is slower than other learning algorithms (lazy algorithm). The accuracy of a KNN classifier is dependent on the quality of the distance function. The distance function quality is a function of domain knowledge. KNN also suffers from the curse of dimensionality.\n",

    "#### Why is this a good candidate for this problem\n",
    "I think that students that pass or fail have a lot in common with each other (they are close to each other) and the number of features they have in common is small relative to the total number of features.

    "Boosting learns fast. Is able to make use of other learning algorithms and combine weak classifiers of these learning algorithms and create arbitrarly accurate classifiers.

    "With the predefined functions above, you will now import the three supervised learning models of your choice and run the `train_predict` function for each one. Remember that you will need to train and predict on each classifier for three different training set sizes: 100, 200, and 300. Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Import the three supervised learning models you've discussed in the previous section.\n",
    "- Initialize the three models and store them in `clf_A`, `clf_B`, and `clf_C`.\n",
